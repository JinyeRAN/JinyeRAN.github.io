This research project focuses on the practical application of semantic segmentation algorithms for crop yield estimation in remote sensing, specifically targeting the Pericarpium Zanthoxyli. It consists of two main components: **model development** and **model evaluation**.

## Model Development

Participated in field surveys for crop observation using remote sensing images and drafted pixel-level annotation standards for Pericarpium Zanthoxyli. Additionally, led the dataset development. 

Optimized the performance of semantic segmentation algorithms, such as SegNet, U-Net, and Mask R-CNN, for remote sensing applications. Then, trained and deployed the Pericarpium Zanthoxyli segmentation model.

## Model Evaluation
The performance of the trained Pericarpium Zanthoxyli segmentation model was comprehensively evaluated through both a validation dataset and field verification, achieving a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of over 90%. 

The results included visualizations of 2D semantic segmentation for Pericarpium Zanthoxyli and 3D segmentation visualizations across two towns.

The model has been practically deployed to estimate the yield of Pericarpium Zanthoxyli over an area exceeding 1,200 square miles, with a patent authorized for the underlying technology.
